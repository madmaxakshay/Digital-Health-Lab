  title: " Health Equity through Health Fact-checking: A Primer "
  description: "Misinfodemics, the idea that viral misinformation can facilitate the
    spread of a particular health outcome or disease, are a public health issue with
    significant momentum, bringing together interdisciplinary organizations and researchers,
    media producers and distributors, technology companies, social media platforms,
    and academic institutions around the world.\n\nAs these groups attempt to address
    challenges surrounding the credibility, amplification and equitable accessibility
    of quality online content - while reducing the impact of problematic health misinformation
    - fact-checking is an increasingly central part of the conversation. But can current
    fact-checking processes and outputs actually work for a topic as complex as health?
    Do fact-checking outputs reach the most vulnerable? Are these initiatives in their
    current form meeting the needs of individuals disproportionately affected by health
    misinformation, including populations in low socioeconomic environments, queer
    communities, and communities of color? And if not, what are alternative solutions
    to addressing digital misinformation in a topic area as critical as health?\n\nOur
    research highlights four key takeaways for the public health advocacy, fact-checking
    and communications communities: \n\n1. Fact-checking health topics requires adherence
    to and creation of public health standards of care that differ from dominant fact-checking
    frameworks.\n2. Biases in what gets selected for fact-checked content reflects
    limited newsroom and organizational resources. \n3. Already vulnerable communities
    stand at greatest risk of further marginalization and compromised safety. \n4.
    Health audiences need a new fact-checking workflow that requires more targeted,
    tailored and practical information without compromising their safety or privacy.
    \n\nIn this primer, we address key questions about the research behind and efficacy
    of health-focused fact-checking, forming the basis of a Do No Harm misinfodemic
    response framework."

  title: " Misinfodemic Simulation Exercise Facilitation Guide "
  description: Borrowing from cybersecurity preparedness workshops and epidemic simulations,
    we have developed a series of exercises for journalists, health practitioners,
    medical and public health students, human rights advocates and community-based
    organizations. Our workshops are designed to cultivate a deeper understanding
    of how challenging addressing digital health misinformation can be, and to collaborate
    in the development of new response pathways.
