  title: '<a name="toolkit-primer"></a> Health Equity Through Health Fact-checking:
    A Primer '
  description: "The world now has more internet users than people with access to essential
    health services such as primary care, dental care, or surgery. As the ease of
    online connectivity increases, we should expect more and more individuals to use
    online content as a primary source of sometimes critical health information. With
    limited availability of in-person health providers or services for certain health
    conditions, the internet plays a crucial role in mediating access to health -
    and fact-checking is increasingly a part of that conversation. Strengthening the
    infrastructure and resources that fact-checkers need to adequately address high
    risk, low-quality health content must be a priority. \n\nIn this primer, we highlight
    the importance of standardized sets of principles to optimize for fact-checks
    that translate into improved health literacy and positive health outcomes, and
    donâ€™t exacerbate mistrust, inequalities or risks.\n"

  title: " Misinfodemic Simulation Exercise Facilitation Guide "
  description: Borrowing from cybersecurity preparedness workshops and epidemic simulations,
    we have developed a series of exercises for journalists, health practitioners,
    medical and public health students, human rights advocates and community-based
    organizations. Our workshops are designed to cultivate a deeper understanding
    of how challenging addressing digital health misinformation can be, and to collaborate
    in the development of new response pathways.
