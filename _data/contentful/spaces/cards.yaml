    [… ]our understanding of exactly how digital infections happen remains focused more on symptoms, looking at the number of shares a given vaccine-hesitancy tweet receives, than on some of the underlying causes, such as the digital infrastructure that makes some internet users more susceptible to encountering false information about immunization.

    Research demonstrates that public-health digital outreach uses a lot of language and strategies that are inaccessible to the populations it is trying to target. [...] Our work on the Credibility Coalition, an effort to develop web-wide standards around online-content credibility, and Path [now Digital Health Lab], a project aimed at translating and surfacing scientific claims in new ways, as part of two efforts of many to think about data standards and information access across different platforms.

  description: 'Misinformation—and what Gyenes [and Mina] calls misinfodemics—are
    a huge threat to public health. The spread of inaccurate health messages has caused
    deaths during Ebola outbreaks, tooth decay and mass hospitalizations in Australia,
    and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles in New York. A new
    project at Meedan called Path [now Digital Health Lab] aims to change this by
    improving information quality, access, diversity, and representation in health
    data infrastructure. '
