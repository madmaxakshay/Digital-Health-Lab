  description: Artificial intelligence techniques may help establish early warning,
    monitoring and evaluation systems for digital content. In collaboration with the
    Harvard School of Public Health and the Oxford Internet Institute, we are examining
    how new methodologies can be used by public health organizations looking to monitor
    and detect misinfodemics, determine what topics within the realm of health misinformation
    to prioritize in intervention designs, and evaluate programs.

  title: Digital Health Equity & Ethics
  description: 'With increases in health misinformation spreading through private
    messaging channels, in forums, and on social media, responses are required at
    scales larger than ever before. Vulnerable communities disproportionately affected
    by health misinformation stand at greatest risk of further marginalization, stigmatization,
    inequitable access to response efforts, and compromised safety. This work investigates
    the limited infrastructure for ethics and accountability in misinfodemic response,
    and, in collaboration with public health researchers and journalists, is prototyping
    a set of ethical guidelines to strengthen equitable health communications efforts. '

  title: Misinfodemic Response
  description: |-
    Ensuring efficacious misinfodemic response involves preparing practitioners for addressing complex digital health misinformation, a special category
    of information with specific and serious associated risks. This work serves to develop, facilitate, and provide resources for implementing collaborative digital health misinformation responses across sectors that align with the safety, privacy, efficacy, and access standards representative of public health duties of care, and to enhance preparedness capacity for organizations around the world.

  title: Health Fact-checking
  description: As organizations around the world are working to reduce the impact
    of problematic health misinformation, fact-checking is an increasing part of the
    conversation. Responding to health misinformation requires specific, accessible,
    tailored and practical information without compromising the safety or privacy
    of target audiences. This set of projects examines the unique elements of health-specific
    fact-checking, and the need for an entirely new, collaborative digital response
    framework for addressing health misinformation.
