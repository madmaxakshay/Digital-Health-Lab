    title: What We Do
    content: "We are developing a standard of care for responding to misinfodemics.
      This involves:\n\n__- conducting applied research__ to improve public health
      through digital innovation, participatory methods, and equity-centered design.\n\n
      __- building a community__ of health practitioners, researchers, journalists,
      activists and end-users actively engaged in reducing health misinformation,
      to support fact-checking organizations and to ensure that health content online
      is engaging, relevant and accessible.\n \n __- hosting misinfodemic response
      exercises__, preparing practitioners for complex and common digital health misinformation
      threats and scenarios, and co-designing new response pathways. \n\n __- documenting
      best practices and sharing resources__ for designing equity-centered health
      communications outputs. "

    title: Research Tracks
    content: "__Health Fact-checking__\n\nAs organizations around the world are working
      to reduce the impact of problematic health misinformation, fact-checking is
      an increasing part of the conversation. Responding to health misinformation
      requires specific, accessible, tailored and practical information without compromising
      the safety or privacy of target audiences. This set of projects examines the
      unique elements of health-specific fact-checking, and the need for an entirely
      new, collaborative digital response framework for addressing health misinformation.\n\n__Health
      & AI__\n\nArtificial intelligence techniques may help establish early warning,
      monitoring and evaluation systems for digital content. In collaboration with
      the Harvard School of Public Health and the Oxford Internet Institute, we are
      examining how new methodologies can be used by public health organizations looking
      to monitor and detect misinfodemics, determine what topics within the realm
      of health misinformation to prioritize in intervention designs, and evaluate
      programs. \n\n\n__Misinfodemic Preparedness__\n\nMisinfodemic simulation exercises
      are an essential tool for preparing practitioners for complex and common digital
      health misinformation threats and scenarios. This work serves to develop, facilitate,
      and provide resources for implementing collaborative digital health misinformation
      responses across sectors that align with the safety, privacy, efficacy, and
      access standards  representative of public health duties of care, and to enhance
      preparedness and response capacities for organizations around the world. \n\n__Digital
      Health Equity & Ethics__\n\nWith increases in health misinformation spreading
      through private messaging channels, in forums, and on social media, responses
      are required at scales larger than ever before. Vulnerable communities disproportionately
      affected by health misinformation stand at greatest risk of further marginalization,
      stigmatization, inequitable access to response efforts, and compromised safety.
      This work investigates the limited infrastructure for ethics and accountability
      in misinfodemic response, and, in collaboration with public health researchers
      and journalists, is prototyping a set of ethical guidelines to strengthen equitable
      health communications efforts. "

    title: " Health Equity through Health Fact-checking: A Primer "
    description: "Misinfodemics, the idea that viral misinformation can facilitate
      the spread of a particular health outcome or disease, are a public health issue
      with significant momentum, bringing together interdisciplinary organizations
      and researchers, media producers and distributors, technology companies, social
      media platforms, and academic institutions around the world.\n\nAs these groups
      attempt to address challenges surrounding the credibility, amplification and
      equitable accessibility of quality online content - while reducing the impact
      of problematic health misinformation - fact-checking is an increasingly central
      part of the conversation. But can current fact-checking processes and outputs
      actually work for a topic as complex as health? Do fact-checking outputs reach
      the most vulnerable? Are these initiatives in their current form meeting the
      needs of individuals disproportionately affected by health misinformation, including
      populations in low socioeconomic environments, queer communities, and communities
      of color? And if not, what are alternative solutions to addressing digital misinformation
      in a topic area as critical as health?\n\nOur research highlights four key takeaways
      for the public health advocacy, fact-checking and communications communities:
      \n\n1. Fact-checking health topics requires adherence to and creation of public
      health standards of care that differ from dominant fact-checking frameworks.\n2.
      Biases in what gets selected for fact-checked content reflects limited newsroom
      and organizational resources. \n3. Already vulnerable communities stand at greatest
      risk of further marginalization and compromised safety. \n4. Health audiences
      need a new fact-checking workflow that requires more targeted, tailored and
      practical information without compromising their safety or privacy. \n\nIn this
      primer, we address key questions about the research behind and efficacy of health-focused
      fact-checking, forming the basis of a Do No Harm misinfodemic response framework."

    title: " Misinfodemic Simulation Exercise Facilitation Guide "
    description: Borrowing from cybersecurity preparedness workshops and epidemic
      simulations, we have developed a series of exercises for journalists, health
      practitioners, medical and public health students, human rights advocates and
      community-based organizations. Our workshops are designed to cultivate a deeper
      understanding of how challenging addressing digital health misinformation can
      be, and to collaborate in the development of new response pathways.
